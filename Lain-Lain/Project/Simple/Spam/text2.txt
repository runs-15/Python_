Mountain anoa have a dark brown or black coat which is very woolly.
Males are usually darker in color than females.
There are very few markings on the body:
on each leg,
there are two faint light spots just above the hooves,
and there are usually no markings on the face or throat.
The tail is relatively short.
Both males and females have horns:
there are relatively short,
straight,
and angled towards the rear.
The horns will grew between 15 and 20 cm long.
Mountain anoa tend to be most active during the morning,
retreating to sheltered areas during the midday hours.
They may seek shelter under large fallen trees,under overhanging rocks,
and in spaces beneath tree roots.
Mud wallows and pools are used for bathing.
The short horns are used in both displays (thrashing at bushes or digging up soil) and in physical altercations:
a bump using the front surfaces of the horns is used to show dominance,
while in fights sharp up ward stabs are used in an attempt to wound the opponent’s belly or sides.
When excited,
mountain anoa vocalize with a short “ moo”.
Mountain anoa are found only on the islands of Sulawesi and Butung in Indonesia.
They are rainforest animals,
and prefer areas with dense vegetation,
permanent sources of water,
and low human disturbance.
